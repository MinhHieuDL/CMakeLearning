8.1 Basic 
- Functions and macros in CMake have very similar characteristics to their same-named counterparts in C/C+
- Functions introduce a new scope and the function arguments become variables accessible inside the function 
body
- Macros, on the other hand, effectively paste their body into the point of the call and the macro arguments 
are substituted as simple string replacement
